//! By default, Tetra runs updates at a fixed tick rate, decoupled from the speed at which
//! the screen is rendering. This means your game's physics will behave consistently regardless
//! of how powerful the player's device is, which is nice! However, it does mean that if the
//! update and render rates don't line up nicely, your game might look a bit choppy.
//!
//! There are two ways of handling this:
//!
//! * Interpolation
//!   * Store both the previous state and the current state, and render somewhere in between the two
//!   * Pros: Accurate, no guesswork
//!   * Cons: Complex, introduces a tiny bit of input lag as you're updating one frame ahead of rendering
//!
//! * Extrapolation
//!   * Store only the current state, and guess what the next state will look like
//!   * Pros: Simple to implement, doesn't cause lag
//!   * Cons: Looks weird when the extrapolated state doesn't end up matching reality
//!
//! The example below shows how to implement very naive forms of these techniques, with the
//! tick rate set extremely low for demonstration purposes.
//!
//! For more information, see these articles:
//!
//! * https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/
//! * http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html
//!
//! If you don't care about any of this, and just want to use an old-school 'lockstep' gameloop, set the
//! `timestep` of your `Context` to `Timestep::Variable`. You will then need to use `time::get_delta_time`
//! in your update and render methods.
